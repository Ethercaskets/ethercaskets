## What is Ethercaskets
Ethercaskets epitomizes ERC40 innovation, boasting a curated collection of 5,000 NFTs while trailblazing as the inaugural platform for Layer 2 flowerpoker gambling. Utilizing Chainlink VRF, it ensures cryptographiocally secure and auditable game results, heralding a new era of trust and transparency in decentralized gambling.

## What's the goal of Ethercaskets
Ethercaskets was created in response to a notable trend in the ERC404 project landscape. We observed numerous projects attempting to replicate the official PANDORA contract, the pioneering ERC404 project. However, many of these projects ended up misusing or exploiting the functionality of the contract, leading to undesirable outcomes for their communities. 

We initially intended to utilize the PANDORA contract fork for our token, but unfortunately, its instability and lack of reliability prompted us to seek an alternative. Consequently, we opted for what we perceive as a superior and more stable fork, the EMERALD contract. Recognizing the potential of the PANDORA/EMERALD idea as a foundation, we went on a mission to build upon its groundwork while adding our own unique twist. Rather than merely replicating what had been done before, we sought to innovate and introduce something fresh to the Ethereum token scene.

Ethercaskets stands out as the first project to introduce a new feature; gambling. This is not just any gambling mechaniosm but a meticulously designed system that leverages layer 2 Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) integration. By integrating Chainlink VRF, we prioritize safety and fairness in the outcomes of our game, ensuring a secure and transparent gambling experience for users.
In essence, Ethercaskets represents a new era of ERC404 projects, where innovation and responsibility are paramount.

## What contract did we build Ethercaskets from
Ethercaskets was built from an updated version of the EMERALD project. EMERALD serves as the foundational contract for Ethercaskets, and we have continuously updated and modified it to suit our project's specific needs and innovations. You can find the updated version of the EMERALD project, which we used as the basis for Ethercaskets on their GitHub repository.
